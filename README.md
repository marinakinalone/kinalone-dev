# Kinalone Dev

Kinalone Dev is my professional website to share my code projects (portfolio), bio, resume, and contact info.

## Built with 
- TypeScript
- React
- SASS
## What's next to do?
- add a Books component
- modify tech stack to something more visually striking
- enhance light/dark mode
- befriend TypeScript even more
- create animations and small easter eggs :)
## What I have learnt from this project
The first version of the portfolio was built with HTML and CSS and this is the first project I decided to refactor using the combination of React and TypeScript. I also love React hooks and wanted to try useContext to implement light/dark mode!
