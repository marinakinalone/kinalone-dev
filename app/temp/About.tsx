          I have always loved art for its cross-disciplinary scope. When I was a researcher in art
          history, I was already using technology to create easy-to-use databases, improve my
          productivity and make the information accessible.{' '}

          After college, I worked in the education field. I see myself as a facilitator between

          I discovered coding when I took an Intro to Computer Science and Cognitive Science class
