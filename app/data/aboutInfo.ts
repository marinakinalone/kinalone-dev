/*
Hi there! I’m Marina Kinalone - developer and UX designer with a background in research and education. 

I'm currently working at Trustly, a fintech company based in Stockholm, Sweden.

Specializing in {{bold}}frontend development{{/bold}}, I love to craft seamless, user-centered experiences. My approach is grounded in research methods honed during my art history days—always learning efficiently and staying at the tech forefront.

From my career as an educator, I discovered my role as a facilitator, bridging gaps between individuals and knowledge. I thrive on building communities, encouraging personal growth, and fostering creativity through active communication.

Championing diversity and collaboration, I'm recognized as a caring and supportive teammate, propelling projects forward with sharp problem-solving skills. I believe in challenging the status quo to unveil optimal, user-centered solutions that spark innovation.

Beyond coding, I'm a fervent creator exploring my creativity through personal projects, dance, and teaching. I am active in social dance communities, and love to discover the world and take pictures with my analog camera.

My coding assistant is my cat, Stormy. She is especially fond of printers.

I come from France, have lived in California, USA, and now live in Stockholm, Sweden.
